about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hi, my name is Tim-Oliver and I am a research software engineer. I work on biomedical image processing and analysis 
  pipelines. Next to my work as software engineer I educate researchers in the best practices of FAIR image processing 
  and analysis. I have worked with a number of different research groups and have experience in a wide range of image 
  processing and analysis tasks.
  
  In my day-to-day work I use a variety of different programming languages and tools. I am experienced in Python and Java,
  and have worked with PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-image and Dask. I am used to work with git and continues integration
  to ensure the quality of the solutions I provide.
  
  I am experienced in working with different imaging modalities from light to electron microscopy and handling all 
  types of imaging data, from small 2D images to large 5D datasets.
  
  I am passionate about making state of the art technology available to people without a computer science 
  background.

          Image Processing and Analysis (IPA), transforming raw image data into quantitative measurements, is an 
          important part of life sciences. This template simplifies the initiation of new IPA projects and streamlines
          the reorganization of existing ones, contributing to research that is more Findable, Accessible, 
          Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) promoting efficiency, reproducibility, and reliability in life 
          sciences research.

          This plugin is used to analyze the point spread function of microscopes. It provides a simple and easy to use
          interface, which allows us to quickly assess the state of our microscopes. The quality measurements are are collected
          and stored in a database, which allows us to track the performance of our microscopes over time.

          In my role as Machine Learning Expert in the Facility for Advanced Imaging and Microscopy I work together with
          our research groups to develop and implement state of the art image processing and analysis pipelines. The projects I 
          work on are a diverse mix, ranging from small scale image analysis tasks to processing of terabyte sized imaging
          datasets. I also educate our users in the best practices of FAIR image processing and analysis.

          Next to researching novel approaches for image restoration, it was always a passion of mine to make our 
          research outputs accessible to the wider non-computer scientist community. Making state of the art technology 
          available to researchers without a computer science background is a challenge I enjoy.

          During my bachelor and master studies I worked as student assistant at the Chair for Bioinformatics and 
          Information Mining. During this time I developed KNIME workflows and plugins for image processing and
          analysis. As part of my work I also contributed to ImageJ and Fiji, two widely used image processing tools in
          the life sciences.

          I developed novel machine learning methods for image restoration in the field of biomedical image analysis.
          As a member of the IMPRS-CellDevoSys school, hosted at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and 
          Genetics (MPI-CBG) in collaboration with the Technische Universität Dresden (TUD), I was part of a vibrant 
          and interdisciplinary research community. I worked together with researchers from biology, chemistry, 
          physics and computer science.

          After completing my four year bachelor studies in computer science at the University of Konstanz I enrolled in
          the one year master program. During my master studies I focused on the basics of computer vision and image 
          processing.

          ## cryoCARE - Content-Aware Image Restoration for Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy Data
          __TO Buchholz, M Jordan, G Pigino, F Jug__
          
          Even highest quality cryo-EM data is inherently noisy and suffers from low contrast. With cryoCARE we present 
          a deep learning-based approach to denoise and improve contrast in cryo-EM data.

          ## Noise2Void - Learning Denoising from Single Noisy Images
          __A Krull\*, TO Buchholz\*, F Jug__
          
          Noise2Void is a self-supervised image denoising method based on deep learning. It does not require clean 
          ground truth data for training, instead it can be trained on single noisy images only.
